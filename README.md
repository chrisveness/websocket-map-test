WebSocket Map Test
==================

Test of using WebSockets to update marker position on Google Map.

This test pushes a JSON message with a random new location for the marker, at random intervals.

`npm start` and open localhost:3000/page to see it in action (you will probably have to supply your own Google Maps key).
